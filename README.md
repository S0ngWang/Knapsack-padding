# Knapsack-padding
Frame padding for MU-MIMO system MAC layer

This project aims to address channel under-utilization problem in Multi-User Multiple Input Multiple Output (MU-MIMO) system 
by selecting and appending frames to each transmission opportunity (TXOP) in a dynamic programming manner.

·Built the system model as knapsack problem where MAC frame are abstracted and quantified as items while TXOP as package
·Developed the algorithm based on dynamic approach for knapsack where the orthogonality and subsequet interference are 
 considered
·Optimized the algorithm using polynomial time approximation scheme that approximates the optimal result with time complexity 
 significantly reduced.
